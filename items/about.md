Emma does not need your money. She already has three therapists, a neurosurgeon, and a whole team of doctors that have already and are continuing to monitor her progress. This isn't a problem needing additional expertise.

Emma needs your encouragement and hope. And quite honestly, so do I. Do you have a story about how you or your child or one of your friends overcame this kind of adversity? I'd love to read it. Do you just want to say that you are sending positive thoughts in Emma's direction? I'd love to pass them along.

If you want to reach out, send an email to [helloEmma@brunow.org][linkEmmaEmail].
